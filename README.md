This project is my portfolio and skill playground. Here, my objective is to showcase my skills in areas such as frontend coding, backend, AI, and cloud.
This serves as the touchpoint between potential employers and myself.
However, rather than just dedicating this project to being a portfolio, I am dedicating this project to being my playground where I can experiment with different tools and skills, 
particularly AI skills such as RAG, vector databases, using pre-trained models with Hugging face, fine-tuning models, and potentially using tools for agentic AI workflows, such as LangGraph, 
etc.
